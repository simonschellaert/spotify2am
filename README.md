# Spotify to Apple Music
Some simple Python 3 scripts to help you into importing your existing Spotify library into Apple Music.  
**Work in progress !**

## Usage

### 1. Export the Spotify songs to an CSV File
The first step is getting the songs you want to import into Apple Music into a CSV file. The simplest way to do this is using [Exportify](https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html).  
If you want to export your whole Spotify library, simply create a new playlist called *All* and drag your whole library into it using the Spotify desktop app. You can then export the playlist *All* using *Exportify*. Save the resulting file as *spotify.csv* in the same directory as the directory you cloned this repo into.

### 2. Match the Spotify songs with their Apple Music identifier
In order to add songs to our Apple Music library, we need their Apple Music identifier. Running `python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` will use the *spotify.csv* file to create a new file *itunes.csv* with each line consisting of the Apple Music identifier of a song in your Spotify library.

### 3. Use an intercepting proxy to retrieve the Apple Music request headers
Start iTunes and [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com) (or another intercepting proxy you like). Make sure SSL Proxying is enabled and working correctly. Next, select a random song on Apple Music you don't have in your library yet, right click and choose 'Add to My Music'. If everything went well, you're now able to view all the request headers in Charles of a request to `https://ld-4.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZDaap.woa/daap/databases/1/cloud-add`. We're only interested in `Cookie`, `X-Dsid` and `X-Guid`. Copy the value of these header and paste them in the appropriate place  in `insert-songs.py` (line 29 and further).  
Next, run `python3 insert-songs.py` and go grab a coffee. You're songs are now being imported into Apple Music.


## Current issues

### API limit rate
Apple Music doesn't like it when we're adding a lot of songs in a small amount of time. If we do so, the API responds to all further request with `403 Too many requests`. After this, you're blocked from the API for an undetermined amount of time. We're currently trying to avoid this by waiting after each request. A delay of 30 seconds seems fine to import large libraries into Apple Music. If your library is smaller, feel free to decrease the delay in `inserts-songs.py`.

### Missing songs
The script I'm using to retrieve the Apple Music identifier for a Spotify song is quite basic. It simply compares the title and artist to find out if a Spotify and Apple Music song match. Some songs don't have the exact same title (extraneous spacing for example) in both services. This results in the script failing to retrieve an identifier for some songs.

### Terminal encoding
Some users are reporting errors like `UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xd8' in ...` when running the scripts. The problem here is that Python is trying to convert UTF-8 characters to ASCII to print them to standard output. This can be solved by setting the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to `utf-8`.  
In Bash, simply call the scripts like this: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 retrieve-identifiers.py` and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 insert-songs.Py`
